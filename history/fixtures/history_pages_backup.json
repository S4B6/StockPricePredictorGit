Goal: establish anti-inflation credibility and contain medium-term inflation risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. 2001-2003 ΓÇô Dot-com bust and cautious cuts</h3>\r\n<p>ECB cuts from 4.75% to 2% as dot-com crash, global slowdown and 9/11 hit demand.

Growth moderate, inflation near 2%, no acute financial stress. ECB sees this as a suitably accommodative, stable stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. 2005-2007 ΓÇô Pre-crisis normalisation</h3>\r\n<p>ECB hikes from 2% to 4% as growth is strong, oil and commodities rise, credit and money expand, and inflation runs above target. Aim: prevent overheating and de-anchoring of inflation expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. 2008-2009 ΓÇô Global Financial Crisis</h3>\r\n<p>After a last hike to 4.25% in July 2008, ECB slashes to 1% after Lehman and deep recession.
